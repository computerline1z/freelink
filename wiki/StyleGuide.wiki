== Style Guide ==

=== Spacing ===

The opening bracket of a function call _does not_ require a space: `blahFunc(2, 3)`

Casts _do not_ require a space.

Arguments _do_ require a space after the comma.

Mathematical and boolean operators _do_ require a space before and after them: `blahFunc(2 + 3, 4 * 5)` and `if (true && false)`


=== Indentation ===

Indentation is done with 2 spaces.

Wrong:
{{{
void someFunc() {
    if (true)
        writefln("This is wrong");
}
}}}

Right:
{{{
void someFunc() {
  if (true)
    writefln("This is right");
}}}

=== Braces and Opening Blocks ===

Braces are on the same level as the block that they open.

Wrong:
{{{
void someFunc()
{
  while (1)
  {
    writefln("Wrong!");
  }
}
}}}

Right:
{{{
void someFunc() {
  while (1) {
    writefln("Right");
  }
}
}}}

=== Everything else ===

All other dirty tricks are acceptable. If the trick is really dirty, document it with comments to explain _why_ (and maybe _how_) it works.
