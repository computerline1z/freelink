In the game, the player assumes the role of a hacker breaking into computer systems world-wide, bouncing his connection off relay stations to avoid detection.
This mechanism is highly stylized, following movie-like hacking conventions of, example, "crack www.test-server.com" or "trace someuser". There is a storyline in the works as well.

The game is written using the [D](http://digitalmars.com/d/index.html) programming language and uses SDL.

Depends on:
  * [GDC](http://dgcc.sourceforge.net/) 0.24 or [DMD](http://digitalmars.com/d/download.html)
  * SDL 1.12

Tested on:
  * ArchLinux Don't Panic
