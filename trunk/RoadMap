 - First working release, 0.1
  - open world description format
   - Use XML, zip-compressed for better storage (Like ODF does) ^^
   - UTF external string storage for easier translation?
    - Exclusive usage of UTF internally? (that's a new one for me :( - downs)
  - basic world for testing
  - timing mechanics (traces, bounces)
  - basic RPG system (extensible computer; modem, etc)
  - randomly generated networks/computers/missions?
  - 
 
 - Computer
  - CPU, RAM, Modem, Firewall?
 - Networks
  - ability to purchase shell accounts? (omouse) THAT IS NEAT. (downs)
  - intranet hacking?
   - Access to sub-networks via gateways (downs) (one sub-level only) (omouse) Agreed. But make that a design limitation, not a code limitation.(downs)
 - Income!
  - Missions
   - totally random generated, random generated by templates, or randomized story tree?
    + randomized templates but a randomized story tree contained within?
     + Do we need a real story? I mean, apart from tutorials. (downs)
     + Yes, why not? (omouse)
      + Let's make the story part of the world definition.
  - Hosting servers for random people? (omouse)
   + Naah. Let's not get _too_ realistic here. Also has nothing to do with the rest of the game. (downs)
   + True but you can kill time and still make some cash. (omouse)
   + If you need to kill time, we screwed up. (downs)
 
 - Programs
  - all will have GUI-counterparts? Or just some?
   - I vote yes. Appeal to the graphics crowd. :)
    - ... should we emulate the network to the level of latency?
     + no, but ping can be useful in determining if a host is up or not
      - Why would a host be not up? imnsho, that only causes time-killing.
       + if you're on the host for too long
        - that's bad. it completely forbids chains longer than five nodes.
         - Remember, the human mind can only focus on MAXIMALLY five to seven things at a time, and most of it will be too busy with the hacking part.
         - Focusing on each part of the tunnel would overload the player.
          + I want to agree, but we could actually test this. Ping == one line of code basically and we can just let the nodes randomly die and see if it's a pain in the ass for us.
           - I can guarantee you that it is. Players hate things they can't control, that surprise them. It screws up their planning. And if you got them to plan, you really don't want to break that.
           - There actually is a practical use for PING.
            - Some hosts might only be reachable from a subnet gateway.
            - Or you might want to check if a host is down from a (D)DOS attack.
             + Ah true. That's a much better idea. -omouse (Whee! -downs) 
  - tracert/showroute
   - Showing an image of how you're connected to a machine? like the connections listing
    - oh, you mean tracert without parameters ... showroute? |Exactly | .. it's not a trace. Traces are already in the game, this would give players the wrong idea. | Oops.
 
 - 1.0 Alpha
  - Last phase where radical new ideas can be introduced
 - 1.0 Beta
  - Working command line client
 
 - Post-1.0
  - GUI client
   - gui client on top of command-line or separate? I vote separate.
   - theming of the gui client (CSS style wouldn't be too bad)
